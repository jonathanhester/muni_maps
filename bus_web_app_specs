1) Persist all routes. Routes shouldn't change frequently so only update every day or week

eg
http://webservices.nextbus.com/service/publicXMLFeed?command=routeList&a=sf-muni

Route:
tag, title, shortTitle

2) Persist all Stops, Directions and Paths for Route. Shouldn't change frequently so only update every day or week

eg
http://webservices.nextbus.com/service/publicXMLFeed?command=routeConfig&a=sf-muni&r=6

Stop:
tag, title, shortTitle (optional), lat, lng, stopId

Direction:
tag, title, name
route_id

DirectionStops:
stop_id
direction_id

(Path is optional. Do this at the end)
Path:
lat,lng
route_id

2) client gives lat/lng bounds requesting data
server returns:
[
 {title: "Haight St & Baker St", lat: "37.77093", lon:"-122.4402599", stopId: "14940", stopTag: "4940",
   routes: [
    {tag: "6", title: "6-Parnassus", direction: "Outbound to the Sunset District"},
    {tag: "71", title: "71-Haight/Noriega", direction: "Outbound to the Sunset District"}
   ]
 },
 ....
]

Client queries service directly to get predictions. Two ways to get predictions 
1) separate request for every stop
eg 
http://webservices.nextbus.com/service/publicXMLFeed?command=predictions&a=sf-muni&stopId=14940
2) bulk request but must use (stops=6|5711&stops=6|4940&stops=71|4940) so watch for query string being too large
http://webservices.nextbus.com/service/publicXMLFeed?command=predictionsForMultiStops&a=sf-muni&stops=6|5711&stops=6|4940&stops=71|4940

Stops
[
 {title: "Haight St & Baker St", lat: "37.77093", lon:"-122.4402599", 
  predictions: [
	{route: "6-Parnassus", direction: "Outbound to the Sunset District", arrivals: "6min, 12min, & 24min"},
	{route: "71-Haight/Noriega", direction: "Outbound to the Sunset District", arrivals: "5min, 14min, & 25min"}]
]
